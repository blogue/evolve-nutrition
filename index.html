          <h3>Dieting doesn't work</h3>
          <p>
            We all know that dieting isn't effective, yet people continue to get stuck in the same destructive cycle jumping from one diet to the next with no results to show for their efforts. The only results from most dieting is excess stress, poor body image and a dysfunctional relationship with food.

          I graduated from Oregon State University with a BS in Human Development and Family Sciences with a focus in Early Childhood Education and a minor in Business in 2009, after which I began my career as a Preschool teacher. <br> <br>

          Reading, researching and talking to people about nutrition became my passion, and I felt fortunate to have found it. I was lucky enough to be able to combine my passion for nutrition and my career as a preschool teacher by helping parents with their children’s eating habits, leading cooking lessons with the kids and teaching nutrition in the preschool. <br> <br>

          Along the way I realized my passion for nutrition and helping others could become a career. I came upon the Nutritional Therapy Association and their Nutritional Therapy Practitioner (NTP) program, and I knew it was for me. Graduating from the Nutritional Therapy Practitioner provided me with the skills and knowledge to help others using holistic nutrition.  Upon graduation, I founded Evolve Nutritional Therapy LLC.

              When I met Alex from Evolve Nutritional Therapy, I was facing a crossroads in my life. I was on the brink of turning 35 years old, 50+ pounds overweight and 5 months away from getting married. After meeting with Alex for the first consultation, I realized much of what I had been taught about nutrition and wellness was misguided. <br> <br> It was very eye-opening but not intimidating. Through Alex's help, I greatly reduced the amount of processed foods in my diet, and ate real whole foods. For the first time in my life I’m not on a diet, but instead have a lifestyle I love to follow. My energy level are higher than ever, my digestion has completely stabilized, I sleep much better, my skin cleared up and I'm all around a happier human being. <br> <br> I did hit that goal (pretty easily actually) but that is not important to me anymore because my long-term health and happiness is more important than a number on a scale ever will be. I would highly recommend his services to anyone that wants to be best version of themselves that they can be.

              After three  years of  making dietary and lifestyle changes I was able to go from 280lbs to 198lbs but, I came to a plateau in my weight loss and body composition journey. I was doing everything that I knew to be right in terms of nutrition and exercise. <br> <br> I decided it was time for help and contacted Alex McMahon at Evolve Nutritional Therapy. I know Alex as a Muay Thai Coach from  Mata Leao Combat Sports and heard him speak about nutrition on frequent occasions. The support and encouragement didn’t end with that consultation, Alex was regularly available to answer any questions I had. He regularly checked in with me to see monitor progress and help trouble shoot any road blocks. <br> <br> After two weeks of adopting the new nutrition and lifestyle habits I noticed vast  improvements in many ares of my life such as sleep quality, more energy throughout the day, mood improvement and stabilization. I was feeling much healthier and happier. I look and feel better than ever, and don’t think I could have accomplished this without the help and support that Alex at Evolve Nutritional Therapy gave along the way.

              I first started to work with Alex at Evolve Nutritional Therapy over a year ago, I was looking for answers for my constant digestive distress. I run my own business and have a very active social life, but my digestive attacks negatively impacted my business and social life. I was tired of living this way and letting IBS be a constant struggle,  that is why I turned to Alex for help. <br> <br> We went through my daily eating and lifestyle habits, and he got me started on progressive elimination diet to try to pinpoint some foods that could be triggering my attacks. Alex always explained the science behind what we were doing, I felt supported throughout the process and the smaller changes really helped me to stay on track with the new habits we agreed upon. <br> <br> Within the first two weeks there was a drastic reduction in my digestive attacks and it only got better! After going through the full elimination diet and reintroduction process I was able to find out that many of the foods I was consuming on a daily basis for years were strong triggers for my IBS attacks. I know that I have an easy to communicate with and supportive resource in Alex McMahon at Evolve Nutritional Therapy. I highly recommend Alex’s nutrition services, it helped change my life in a very positive way.

            <h3>Nutrition</h3>
          </div>
          <p>
            Many modern health challenges are the result of imbalances and weaknesses in the body caused by poor nutrition and lifestyle factors. The human body is innately intelligent and has the power to heal and repair itself when given the proper nutrition and implementing a healthier lifestyle. Empower yourself with nutrition and take charge of your own health!

            <h3>Sleep</h3>
          </div>
          <p>
            Research suggests that being sleep deprived on a consistent basis significantly impairs psychomotor function, memory retrieval, work productivity, fat loss, muscle building, blood sugar regulation, food cravings, willpower and hormonal function. Getting eight to nine hours of quality restorative sleep is downright necessary to be happy healthy individuals who function at a high level.

            <h3>Nutritious Movement</h3>
          </div>
          <p>
            Our bodies are beautifully designed to move often and at varying degrees of intensity. Low intensity movements like hiking, yoga, walking, bike riding or snow shoeing are much different than higher intensity movements like sprinting, weight training, high intensity interval training or martial arts. Both high intensity and low intensity healthy movements have benefits and we need them both.

            <h3>Stress Management</h3>
          </div>
          <p>
            The studies of stress and the negative impacts on health in the past few years have been eye opening, which is why it can no longer be overlooked. At Evolve Nutritional Therapy I recognize that health spans much further than just nutrition and for that reason stress management is one of the pillars of my philosophy on holistic health.
