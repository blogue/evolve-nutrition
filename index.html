          <h3>Dieting doesn't work</h3>
          <p>
            We all know that dieting isn't effective, yet people continue to get stuck in the same destructive cycle jumping from one diet to the next with no results to show for their efforts. The only results from most dieting is excess stress, poor body image and a dysfunctional relationship with food.

        <h2>My Story</h3>

        <p class="span-3-of-3 story">
          I graduated from Oregon State University with a BS in Human Development and Family Sciences with a focus in Early Childhood Education and a minor in Business in 2009, after which I began my career as a Preschool teacher. <br> <br>

          Reading, researching and talking to people about nutrition became my passion, and I felt fortunate to have found it. I was lucky enough to be able to combine my passion for nutrition and my career as a preschool teacher by helping parents with their children’s eating habits, leading cooking lessons with the kids and teaching nutrition in the preschool. <br> <br>

          Along the way I realized my passion for nutrition and helping others could become a career. I came upon the Nutritional Therapy Association and their Nutritional Therapy Practitioner (NTP) program, and I knew it was for me. Graduating from the Nutritional Therapy Practitioner provided me with the skills and knowledge to help others using holistic nutrition.  Upon graduation, I founded Evolve Nutritional Therapy LLC.
