          <h3>Dieting doesn't work</h3>
          <p>
            We all know that dieting isn't effective, yet people continue to get stuck in the same destructive cycle jumping from one diet to the next with no results to show for their efforts. The only results from most dieting is excess stress, poor body image and a dysfunctional relationship with food.

          I graduated from Oregon State University with a BS in Human Development and Family Sciences with a focus in Early Childhood Education and a minor in Business in 2009, after which I began my career as a Preschool teacher. <br> <br>

          Reading, researching and talking to people about nutrition became my passion, and I felt fortunate to have found it. I was lucky enough to be able to combine my passion for nutrition and my career as a preschool teacher by helping parents with their children’s eating habits, leading cooking lessons with the kids and teaching nutrition in the preschool. <br> <br>

          Along the way I realized my passion for nutrition and helping others could become a career. I came upon the Nutritional Therapy Association and their Nutritional Therapy Practitioner (NTP) program, and I knew it was for me. Graduating from the Nutritional Therapy Practitioner provided me with the skills and knowledge to help others using holistic nutrition.  Upon graduation, I founded Evolve Nutritional Therapy LLC.

          <blockquote>
            When I met Alex from Evolve Nutritional Therapy, I was facing a crossroads in my life. I was on the brink of turning 35 years old, 50+ pounds overweight and 5 months away from getting married. After meeting with Alex for the first consultation, I realized much of what I had been taught about nutrition and wellness was misguided. <br> <br> It was very eye-opening but not intimidating. Through Alex's help, I greatly reduced the amount of processed foods in my diet, and ate real whole foods. For the first time in my life I’m not on a diet, but instead have a lifestyle I love to follow. My energy level are higher than ever, my digestion has completely stabilized, I sleep much better, my skin cleared up and I'm all around a happier human being. <br> <br> I did hit that goal (pretty easily actually) but that is not important to me anymore because my long-term health and happiness is more important than a number on a scale ever will be. I would highly recommend his services to anyone that wants to be best version of themselves that they can be.

        <h2>Evolve Nutritional Therapy's Philosophy</h2>
      </div>

      <div class="row philosophy">
        <i class="ion-ios-nutrition-outline"></i>
        <h3>Nutrition</h3>
        <p>
          I believe that by addressing and managing the foundations of health while respecting the bio-individuality of each person’s body, optimal health can achieved. The most important foundation of health is a properly-prepared nutrient-dense diet that provides the body with the raw materials for mental and physical well-being. Many modern health challenges are the result of imbalances and weaknesses in the body caused by poor nutrition and lifestyle factors. The human body is innately intelligent and has the power to heal and repair itself when given the proper nutrition and implementing a healthier lifestyle. Empower yourself with nutrition and take charge of your own health!
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="row philosophy">
        <i class="ion-ios-cloudy-night-outline"></i>
        <h3>Sleep</h3>
        <p>
         Research suggests that being sleep deprived on a consistent basis significantly impairs psychomotor function, memory retrieval, work productivity, immune system function, insulin sensitivity,endocrine balance, athletic performance ,cellular regeneration, fat loss, muscle building, blood sugar regulation, food cravings, willpower and hormonal function. Many of the daily choices we make from the foods we eat to the amount of time we spend on  laptops and smart phones impact our sleep. Getting eight to nine hours of quality restorative sleep is downright necessary to be happy healthy individuals who function at a high level.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="row philosophy">
        <i class="ion-android-bicycle"></i>
        <h3>Nutritious Movement</h3>
        <p>
          The way you move and the positions you put your body in throughout the day have a direct affect on your health, that is why movement should be viewed as a skill. Incorrect movement patterns lead to dysfunction, over time causing pain and injury. Our bodies are beautifully designed to move often and at varying degrees of intensity. Low intensity movements like hiking, yoga, walking, bike riding or snow shoeing are much different than higher intensity movements like sprinting, weight training, high intensity interval training or martial arts. Both high intensity and low intensity healthy movements have benefits and we need them both.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="row philosophy">
        <i class="ion-happy-outline"></i>
        <h3>Stress Management</h3>
        <p>
          The studies of stress and the negative impacts on health in the past few years have been eye opening, which is why it can no longer be overlooked. If you have all other aspects of holistic health dialed in but live a stressful lifestyle, it can ruin even the best efforts. Stress can negatively impact just about every aspect of health from digestions to sleep quality. At Evolve Nutritional Therapy I recognize that health spans much further than just nutrition and for that reason stress management is one of the pillars of my philosophy on holistic health. I believe that a daily practice of mindful stress reduction  is essential, and can take many different forms.
